# http-server: a command-line http server

`http-server` is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server.  It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

## To Run:
npm install

npm start

*Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your server*

You should see the turtle image in the screenshot above hosted at that URL. See
the `./public` folder for demo content.
